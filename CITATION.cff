abstract: >-
  The multi-lingual Semantic Tagger is an automatic semantic
  analysis tool that you can use to tag your text so you can
  extract token level semantic tags from the tagged text.
  This tagger supports Chinese, Italian and Spanish
  languages. Similar to the English version, it can support
  any semantic tagset, however the currently released tagset
  is for the UCREL Semantic Analysis System (USAS) semantic
  tags. In addition to the USAS tags, you will also see the
  lemmas and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in the text. For
  these languages, the tagger can also identify and tag
  Multi Word Expressions (MWE), i.e., expressions formed by
  two or more words that behave like a unit such as 'Pa√≠ses
  Bajos'.
